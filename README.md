This is a simple To-Do application built with ReactJS, Redux, and Material-UI. It allows users to add, view, edit, delete, and mark tasks as important. Tasks are persisted in local storage, so they are not lost on page reloads.

Features
Add Task: Users can input a task into a text field and add it to the list by pressing a button or pressing Enter.
View Tasks: All added tasks are displayed in a list format.
Edit Task: Each task has an edit button that opens a popup for editing the task.
Delete Task: Each task has a delete button that removes the task from the list.
Mark Task as Important: Tasks can be marked as important by clicking on a star icon.
Mark Task as Completed: Tasks can be marked as completed without deleting them.
Persistent Storage: Tasks are saved to local storage, so they are not lost on page reloads.
Important Tasks Section: Important tasks are displayed in a separate section for easy identification.
Technologies Used
ReactJS: For building the user interface.
Redux: For state management.
